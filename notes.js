// trying to have the user login, however I am at the point where I am comparing passwords, 

// the password that the user entered and the password stored in the database for that user 

// how can I get access to that input field where the user enters a password 

// SO I can properly compare passwords.

// how can I access the currently logged in user, within the join club controller and 

// properly update their status

// now I need a way to use conditionals within index 

// that if the users membership status is member only show the author and date 
//      and not the title or text?
